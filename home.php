It is supposed to complement their technical knowledge on traditional dynamic web programming and give them a practical exercise on using an AJAX framework. The proposed trainings focus on implementing examples of web applications web applications that facilitate participatory information sharing, interoperability, user-centered design, and collaboration on the WWW.</p>
<p>The program of this teaching unit aims at increasing technical skills of students on what they are already able to do in “Web 1.0”. It provides them with new techniques to design and implement more user-interface, software, storage facilities and network platform computing solutions. The proposed training covers practical exercises on building dynamic web sites according to the concept of “Web-as-participation-platform” that offers the final user the complete freedom to contribute. On this issue, based on the jQuery library and the AJAX framework, some key features based on real cases studies (user registration, user authentication, instant discussions, news feeds, interactive management of data, on-line file management, etc.) will be treated in deep. According to the overall objectives of the master degree, a special attention will be also addressed to the implementation of dashboard interfaces (key performance indicators, charts, statistics, etc.) for enterprise decision makers.</p>";
